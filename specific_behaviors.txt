This file includes details in the behavior of the compiler in certain situations.

> Non-reached sections:
    When a block has a section that is never reached, this section is not
    semantically analysed.

> Short-circuiting:
    When a condition can be short-circuited by either the first or the second argument,
    the argument that is not necessary is not calculated. This includes function calls.

> Overloading names:
    Currently function overloading is not allowed.

> Function declaration and definition:
    Currently the parameters of a function's declaration and definition must match types,
    but not names, necessarily. This can be further looked at.
