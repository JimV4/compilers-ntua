This file includes details in the behavior of the compiler in certain situations.

> Short-circuiting:
    When the result of a logical operation can be evaluated just by the first argument, the second
    argument is not evaluated.

> Function overloading:
    Function overloading cannot happen in the range of one scope, but two functions can share the
    same name and/or signature if they are defined in different scopes.

> Function declarations and definitions:
    A function declaration must always be followed by its corresponding function definition.
    The parameters of a function's declaration and definition must match types and can not match
    names.
